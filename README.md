## Features
- **React Hooks**: Utilizes major hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`.
- **Timed Events**: Implements `setTimeout` and `setInterval` for game logic.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Handles asynchronous operations using `async/await` and AJAX calls.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive UI**: Smooth card-flipping animations and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: Core language for the game logic.
- **CSS**: Styling the game for an appealing look.
- **HTML**: Basic markup for the game structure.
- **AJAX**: Asynchronous calls for fetching game data.

## How to Play
1. Click on a card to flip it over.
2. Try to find and match pairs of cards.
3. If the cards match, they remain flipped over.
4. If the cards do not match, they will flip back after a short delay.
5. The game ends when all pairs are matched.
